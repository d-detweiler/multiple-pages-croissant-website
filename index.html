      A croissant is a French pastry known for its crescent shape and flaky
      texture, made from a laminated yeast dough similar to puff pastry. It is
      inspired by the Austrian kipferl and has a rich history, with origins
      tracing back to Central Europe. Croissants are typically enjoyed plain or
      filled with various ingredients, such as ham and cheese or chocolate. For
      those interested in making them, there are numerous recipes available that
      guide you through the process of creating these delicious pastries from
      scratch.
